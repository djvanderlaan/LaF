  saved to and read from YAML-files.  For CSV files the data models can also be
  automatically detected. Blaise data models are also supported. (see laf_open,
  write_dm, read_dm, read_dm_blaise, detect_dm_csv)
* The ability to set the levels of columns.  When reading these columns are
  automatically converted to factors. 
* Some routines were added to read specific or random lines from a text file
  (see get_lines, sample_lines) and to determine the number of lines in a text
  file (see determine_nlines).

  size of the file exceeded 2 Gb.

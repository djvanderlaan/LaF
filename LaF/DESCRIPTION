Title: Fast access to large ASCII files
Version: 0.6

Description: The LaF package provides methods for fast access to large ASCII
    files.  Currently the following file formats are supported: comma separated
    format (csv) and fixed width format. It is assumed that the files are too
    large to fit into memory, although the package can also be used to
    efficiently access files that do fit into memory. Methods are provided to
    access and process files blockwise. Furthermore, an opened file can be
    accessed as one would an ordinary data.frame. The LaF vignette gives an
    overview of the functionality provided.

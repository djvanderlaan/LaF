\title{Create a connection to a fixed width file.}
\usage{
laf_open_fwf(
  filename,
  column_types,
  column_widths,
  column_names = paste("V", seq_len(length(column_types)), sep = ""),
  dec = ".",
  trim = TRUE,
  ignore_failed_conversion = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{character containing the filename of the fixed width file.}

\item{column_types}{character vector containing the types of data in each of 
the columns. Valid types are: double, integer, categorical and string.}

\item{column_widths}{numeric vector containing the width in number of character
of each of the columns.}

\item{column_names}{optional character vector containing the names of the 
columns.}

\item{dec}{optional character specifying the decimal mark.}

\item{trim}{optional logical specifying whether or not whitespace at the end
of factor levels or character strings should be trimmed.}

\item{ignore_failed_conversion}{ignore (set to \code{NA}) fields that could 
not be converted.}
}
\value{
Object of type \code{\linkS4class{laf}}. Values can be extracted from this object 
using indexing, and methods such as \code{\link{read_lines}}, \code{\link{next_block}}.
}
\description{
A connection to the file filename is created. Column types have to be 
specified. These are not determined automatically as for example 
read.fwf does. This has been done to increase speed.
}
\details{
After the connection is created data can be extracted using indexing (as in a
normal data.frame) or methods such as read_lines and next_block can be used 
to read in blocks. For processing the file in blocks the (faster) convenience
function process_blocks can be used.


Only use \code{ignore_failed_conversion } when you are sure that the column
specification is correct. Otherwise, this option can hide an incorrect 
specification.

LaF version 0.8.6
===============================================================================
* Bug fixed in csv-reader with separators in first line contained in quotes.

LaF version 0.8.5
===============================================================================
* Allow user to set encoding for `read_dm_blaise`. As these files are usually
  used on windows systems the default encoding is latin-1.

LaF version 0.8
===============================================================================
* Detects and ignores byte-order-mark
* Added option to ignore (set NA) fields that could not be converted; 
  previously this generated an error.

LaF version 0.7
===============================================================================
* Fixed memory leak
* Added option to show progress bar in process_blocks

LaF version 0.6.3
===============================================================================
* Minor update. Fixes error in detect_dm_csv with sample = TRUE. As reported
  by spinwards. 

LaF version 0.6.2
===============================================================================
* Minor update. Fixes error with '~' in the path name.

LaF version 0.6.1
===============================================================================
* Minor update. Fixes bug in the C++ code. This bug only affected colfreq and
  colnmissing one some platforms when there are missing values in the numeric
  columns. 

LaF version 0.6
===============================================================================
* Internal changes: switched documentation to roxygen; changes to namespace and
  description files to pass tests.

LaF version 0.5
===============================================================================
* Added ability to use data models for opening files. These contain a 
  description of the column names and column types etc. The data models can be
  saved to and read from YAML-files.  For CSV files the data models can also be
  automatically detected. Blaise data models are also supported. (see laf_open,
  write_dm, read_dm, read_dm_blaise, detect_dm_csv)
* The ability to set the levels of columns.  When reading these columns are
  automatically converted to factors. 
* Some routines were added to read specific or random lines from a text file
  (see get_lines, sample_lines) and to determine the number of lines in a text
  file (see determine_nlines).
* Fixed bug with nrows, which could return the wrong number of lines when the
  size of the file exceeded 2 Gb. 

LaF version 0.4
===============================================================================
* Added methods for the calculation of simple column statistics such as mean, 
  sum, number of missings, frequency table, min, max. 
* Fixed bug in skip option in laf_open_csv on windows machines with files with 
  DOS-line breaks
* laf_open_csv and laf_open_fwf now also accept r'isch column types: numeric, 
  and factor instead of double and categorical.
* Fixed bug with checking if file can be opened on some windows network shares

LaF version 0.3
===============================================================================
* Fixed bug with categorical columns. The levels of the categorical columns not
  always match those in the file.
* Added option to laf_open_fwf and laf_open_csv to trim white space from string
  and categorical columns.
* Added option to laf_open_csv to skip the first lines in the file.
* Added ability to read floating point numbers in scientific format.
* Added tests.
